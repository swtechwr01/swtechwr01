# About Me

I am a tech writer and student who understands the value of continued learning. I earned my bachelor's degree in Information Technology (2019). I am enrolled as a full-time student at Colorado State University while working full-time to earn my MBA in Product Management. Earning this credential will benefit my career in API technical writing. It will give me a strong understanding of product development, market analysis, and user needs, which are all crucial for creating effective documentation. Additionally, the skills I will gain in project management, communication, and strategic thinking will enhance my ability to collaborate with cross-functional teams and create better user-focused content.
